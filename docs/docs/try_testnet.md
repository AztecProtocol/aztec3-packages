The Aztec Testnet is live! You can read the announcement [here](TODO). If you would like to contribute to the continuous testing of the Aztec Network, you can take part in:

- [Running a validator node](#validator-node)
- [Running a prover node](#prover-node)
- [Deploying an app onto testnet](#develop-on-aztec-testnet)

## Run a testnet node

It is recommended to read the [full "Run a node" section](./run_node/concepts/governance/governance.md]) to fully understand how decentralization and governance works on the Aztec testnet.

### Validator node

Follow the [sequencer guide](./run_node/guides/run_nodes/how_to_run_validator_sequencer.md).

### Prover node

Follow the [prover guide](./run_node/guides/run_nodes/how_to_run_prover.md).
